Imperfect ideas
	main objective: make a good minecraft dungeons
	
	what is minecraft dungeons
		a dungeon crawler
		you explore
		you refine items
		you fight
	
	in exploration you
		traverse a procedurally generated dungeon
		you find chests
		you find merchants
		you find currencies and loot
		
		you always search for more, it being loot or enemies
			interesting, powerful, risk // reward, no wasting time
	
	in looting you
		seek better gear by chests
		by enemies
		by crafting
		
		you always seek the most perfect definition of power
			personal // modular, mechanic-changing, risk // reward
			by the most interesting (preferably) or fast way <- [you can control that]
	
	in fighting
		want to feel a challenge to get better items
		or <- [you can create a good balance]
		want to feel nice about annihilating one or two hordes with style
		
		either way, you want to destroy, and only that
			predictable but hard, outstanding music (of course), disbalanced (takes one aspect of fighting and elevates to the absolute)
	
	what dungeons does good?
		list:
			specific weapons change the way of fighting
				lifesteal // potion barrier makes you ignore health and focus on always be hitting something
				bows desintegrate loads of enemies for the price of being vulnerable
				summonables are the sacrifice to enemy hits, making your health more stable
				all area effect explosions are centered on you, forcing you to jump on the enemies, tanking hits and then disintegrating everything
				some artifacts gives buffs, but force you to being in an certain area
			some weapons feel really powerful because it is disbalanced (daggers and double axes)
			you can focus all in movement if you want to skip the entire level
		conclusion:
			make mechanic/movement changing gear
			purposefully disbalance weapons towards certain goals and make them excel at it
	
	what dungeons does bad? (makes the impression, at least)
		list:
			nearly all the enchants are bad in early game, barely helping at all, most notable on armor
			all loot are random and the dozens of levels have abyssal loot pools (1:10 good gear)
			feels all the same after some time
			the progression is really slow, just speeding up by pure gambling, speculation and exploits (stronghold skip)
			not all types of weapons can carry on the game, most are slow and not powerful, comparing to the goats
			grind is really boring, for a dungeon crawler this is absurd
			the enchant reroll and level upgrade is really expensive and boring
			the inventory becomes really messy really fast
			the map is above the gameplay (literally unplayable)
		conclusion:
			make enchants meaningful, quality over quantity
			make some hard levels with minimal, direct loot pools
			make procedural generated levels feel new (somehow)
			focus on the fun of exploring, looting and fighting
			make inventory more organized
			map at the bottom or top, simple
Vigorous mechanics:
	cost // difficulty // risk // reward // progression
	
	exploration
		cost: time
		difficulty: terrain, enemies
		risk: losing items, death
		reward: loot, enemies, currency, lore
		progression: rare pathways that lead to new areas
	
	item management
		cost: items, currency
		difficulty: game modifiers, aspect combination knowledge
		risk: transforming good items in bad items, having difficult game modifiers
		reward: powerful items
		progression: always get xp from using, that can be used to modify the luck // rng
	
	fighting
		cost: exploring, items // currency, time
		difficulty: dodge, attack, defend, preserve health, terrain
		risk: death
		reward: loot, items
		progression: scaling difficulty, variety and quantity
Execution:
	terrain
	items
		weapon
			health: lifesteal // scythe
			attack: critical // axe
			speed: daggers
		armor
			health: all in // tank
			attack: all in // scorching
			speed: all in // winged
		shield
			health: absorption
			attack: deflection
			speed: boost
	stats
		health
		attack
		speed
	inventory
		equip area (multiple sets // builds that can be switched)
		backpack area
		currency
		item refining
			stats
			aspects
mechanics
	enemies
		attack
		movement
			get player if near
			go to player
			how:
				jump in a straight line
				dashes circulating
				walks normal and dash backwards
			
	player
		attack
		defense
		movement
			normal wasd
			jump: move up
			crouch: brief inv
			combos:
				normal+jump: large dash, target to nearby enemy
				normal+crouch: medium roll, inv
				jump+crouch: increases crouch momentum
				crouch+jump: increases jump height
				jump+normal: airborne movement
				crouch+normal: slow movement
				
				normal = move to 8 directions
				jump = goes airborne, add momentum in the first frames, goes back to ground 
				crouch = goes to lower ground, add momentum in the first frames, slow down movement afterwards
				
				momentum = adds to next input, it dissipates if no movement
				
			dash (normal+input)
				jump: large move, 
				crouch: medium move, inv
				jump + crouch: large move, slide to nearby enemy, inv
	world
		maze spawn ✔
			recursive maze ✔
				add tile ✔
				do this until no ramifications left ✔
					add possible ramification ✔
						for all 4 directions ✔
						if no out of bounds and no filled cell ✔
					test next ramification, with the possible array ✔
						add tile at this ramification ✔
						add ramification to path array ✔
				transform path array into sprite ✔
				add the path type and tile type to the map array ✔
		room spawn
		enemy spawn
		shop spawn
	power ups


goals:
	world
		rooms
			general
				map generation
					get room presets (normal box), size
					get preset entrances (normal box) and, by an algorithm, select the next room (normal box)
					after deciding, construct the entire room and map
					generate pathfinding on creation
				normal square room ✔
					box (4 sides, no obstacles, one enemy) ✔
			battle
			upgrade
			savepoint
		droppables
	inventory
		items
			modifiers
	animation
	music
	
	
	hitbox algorithm ✔
		list all possible colisions (enemies, drops, walls, player, bullets) ✔
		fragment them into a grid (managed by the room script) ✔
			for all player and entity, locate in grid ✔
				if nothing else is in the grid, skip ✔
				if something other is in the grid: ✔
					test for all hitboxes (find by raycasting the intersection beetween the hitboxes) ✔
					if hitboxes matches, send function to both hitboxes ✔
	
	hitbox movement integration:
		make hitbox work for all types of movement
			for bullets
				
			for entities and players
				if wall
	
	inputs for movement, attack and parry ✔ +-
		move:
			wasd for basic move
				change velocity to another direction
			space for dash
				lock velocity changes mid-dash
				increase drastically the velocity on the last inputed direction
		attack: j
			spawn a slash bullet (depend on item)
			deals damage only on enemies
			small knockback on enemy and player
			doenst lock movement
			charge for different attack
		defense: k
			lock movement
			on any time, takes less damage
			on perfect input, negate all damage and destroy bullet
				auto remove shield after parry without cooldown
			small cooldown after releasing the shield
	bullets: ✔ +-
		wait for a condition -> send function to all inside of hitbox
			touch and break, cooldown, await hit frame, etc
			destroy itself after touch or cooldown
		movement:
			predetermined on spawn
			presets: (later)
				movement based on function
	enemies ✔ +-
		multishoot (spiral knives)
			spawn 8 knives in a spiral circle
				for loop 8
				PI/4 * i + get_angle_to(target.position)
			based on player movement
			ai
				goes away from the player slowly
				attacks more frequently when near
		sniper (aims and does hitscan attack 3 times)
			awaits 5 sec
			lock target
			await 1 sec - fire
			when near, hides and goes invisible
			dont move
		knight (defend and dash attack)
			ai
				if player is away - move
				if player is near
					is directly going towards? - defend
						takes less damage
						cooldown after using shield
					is trying to escape? more or less in range? - dash attack
						lock target and moves rapidly
						create a bullet
	boss -- (mix of all)
